YAMVC - change log
=============

##Propositions
* It should be possible to add callback which will be fired only once
* We should be able to add combine listeners using only one `addEventListener` execution, ex.
`addEventListener('render:[button]click')` which should assign click listener to button element after DOM was rendered
